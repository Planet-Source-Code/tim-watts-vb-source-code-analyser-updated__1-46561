(VB) Source Code Analyser

Anaylse your Visual Basic source code, improve it by identifying unused variables, constants or routines.

Works either by project or project group.  Provides basic file and project statistics

Can be run either as an Add-In or via a standalone executable.  If you want to run it as an AddIn it should become available on the AddIn menu just by compiling the AddIn dll (SCAAddIn.vbp).

Any ideas for improvement?  Any problems?  Please let me know what you think.
